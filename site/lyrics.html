		Oh, there she goes again
		Every morning it's the same
		You walk on by my house
		I wanna call out your name
		
		I wanna tell you how beautiful you are from where I'm standing
		You got me thinking what we could be 'cause
		
		I keep craving, craving, you don't know it but it's true
		Can't get my mouth to say the words they wanna say to you
		This is typical of love
		Can't wait anymore, I won't wait
		I need to tell you how I feel when I see us together forever
		
		In my dreams you're with me
		We'll be everything I want us to be
		And from there, who knows?
		Maybe this will be the night that we kiss for the first time
		Or is that just me and my imagination?
		
		We walk, we laugh, we spend our time walking by the ocean side
		Our hands are gently intertwined
		A feeling I just can't describe
		All this time we spent alone, thinking we could not belong to something so damn beautiful
		So damn beautiful
		
		I keep craving, craving, you don't know it, but it's true
		Can't get my mouth to say the words they wanna say to you
		This is typical of love
		I can't wait anymore, I won't wait
		Need to tell you how I feel when I see us together forever
		
		In my dreams, you're with me
		We'll be everything I want us to be
		And from there, who knows?
		Maybe this will be the night that we kiss for the first time
		Or is that just me and my imagination? (Whoa, oh)
		
		Imagination (whoa, oh, whoa, oh)
		Imagination (whoa, oh)
		(Whoa, oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, ooh)
		
		In my dreams, you're with me
		We'll be everything I want us to be
		And from there, who knows?
		Maybe this will be the night that we kiss for the first time
		
		Or is that just me and my imagination
		I keep craving, craving, you don't know it, but it's true
		Can't get my mouth to say the words they wanna say to you
